# Deliverables

The link to the [backend or service](https://fake-news-back.onrender.com) that allows interacting directly with the model, either to detect the language of a text or to determine its veracity, is provided. The path https://fake-news-back.onrender.com/docs can be consulted to obtain the documentation of the exposed API and to be able to communicate with it.

In addition, the link to the [public web site](https://fake-news-front.onrender.com) that allows convenient interaction with the model is provided.

Both deliverables were deployed on a free plan of the Render platform. In this plan, projects are taken into a sleep mode after 15 minutes of inactivity. Therefore, the first time they are consulted may present significant delays (while they are fully activated). In order to have a proper experience with the web page it is advisable to first access the backend link (using the first link) and wait until you get a “Hello,World” response in the browser. Once received, the service will be on and using the website will be safe. Otherwise, the web page will show an error because it cannot communicate with the service.

To facilitate the deployment and management of the source code of the two components, separate repositories with their respective environments were used:

- [Backend source code / service](https://github.com/davidps79/fake_news_back.git).
- [Source code of the frontend / web page](https://github.com/davidps79/fake_news_front.git).
