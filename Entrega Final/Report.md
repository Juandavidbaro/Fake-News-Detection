## Introduction

In the digital age, the proliferation of fake news has become a significant problem affecting public opinion and decision-making. Detecting and filtering fake news is crucial to maintaining the integrity of information and trust in the media. This project addresses the problem by developing machine learning models, trained on true and false news data, to accurately classify articles.

Detecting fake news is vital not only to protect individuals from misinformation but also to preserve the credibility of news sources. Applying machine learning to this problem offers a scalable and adaptable solution that can handle the dynamic nature of fake news. This project focuses on developing a robust model using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms.

## Theory

**Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
NLP is essential for analyzing and understanding textual data. In this project, it is used to preprocess texts, remove noise, and extract relevant features. TF-IDF vectorization is employed to convert texts into numerical features that machine learning models can process.

**Logistic Regression:**
Logistic Regression is a statistical method for binary classification that calculates the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class. It is chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in classification tasks.

**TF-IDF Vectorization:**
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a technique that measures the importance of a word in a document relative to a corpus. It helps highlight significant words while reducing the influence of common terms.

## Evaluation Metrics

The metrics used to evaluate model performance include:

- **Accuracy:** Proportion of correctly classified instances.
- **Precision:** Ratio of true positives to the sum of true and false positives.
- **Recall:** Ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.
- **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of model performance.

## Methodology

**Data Collection and Preparation:**
Two Kaggle datasets were used, combining fake and real news into a single dataframe. Unnecessary columns were removed, and missing values were appropriately handled, ensuring the data was clean and ready for analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
An EDA was conducted to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data:

- **Visualization of Article Distribution:** The proportions of fake and true news were graphed to gain a comprehensive overview of the data.

- **Analysis of Title and Article Lengths:** The average lengths and distributions of the texts were examined to identify patterns or significant differences between fake and real news.

- **Word Clouds:** Word clouds were generated to visualize the most frequent words in both types of news, helping identify distinctive terms that could be relevant for classification.

## Feature Extraction

To convert texts into numerical features, TF-IDF vectorization was used. This method assigns weights to words based on their frequency in the document and their inverse frequency in the corpus, capturing the relevance of each term in the context of the dataset.

## Model Training

Three machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

- **Logistic Regression:** Chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification tasks.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A method based on the proximity of instances in the feature space.
- **Decision Tree:** An interpretable algorithm that creates a model based on sequential decisions.

GridSearchCV was employed to tune the hyperparameters of each model, using cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the results.

**Analysis of Results**

**Logistic Regression:**
Logistic Regression proved to be the most effective model, with outstanding performance across all evaluated metrics. Its high accuracy (96.98%) and balance between precision (96.97%) and recall (96.98%) indicate that the model generalizes well and effectively distinguishes between true and false news. This robust performance suggests that the combination of TF-IDF features and the simplicity of the model help avoid overfitting.

**K-Nearest Neighbors:**
The KNN model, while less effective than Logistic Regression, achieved acceptable accuracy (84.10%). However, its lower performance suggests that this method may be more sensitive to hyperparameter selection and dataset size.

**Decision Tree:**
The Decision Tree showed intermediate performance with an accuracy of 86.30%. Although it is interpretable and can handle non-linear relationships, its effectiveness was lower compared to Logistic Regression. Hyperparameter tuning was crucial to avoid overfitting, especially by controlling the depth of the tree.

## Comparison with Literature

Our results are in line with state-of-the-art methods reported in the literature for fake news detection. The high accuracy and balanced precision and recall values of Logistic Regression confirm its effectiveness, comparing favorably with more complex approaches such as neural networks or ensemble models.

## Impact of the Solution in the Context of the Problem

**Media and Public Trust:**
Implementing a fake news detection system can significantly impact media and public trust. Media outlets can use these models to filter suspicious content before publication, reducing the spread of misinformation. This could restore public trust in news sources, knowing that active measures are being taken to ensure information accuracy.

**Social Media Platforms:**
Social media platforms can greatly benefit from these models to identify and label fake news, limiting its dissemination. By doing so, the reach of misinformation can be reduced, protecting users from misleading content. Additionally, social media can offer tools to users to verify the authenticity of news, improving digital literacy and critical information skills.

**Public Policy and Regulation:**
From a public policy perspective, implementing fake news detection technologies can help governments combat misinformation, especially during critical periods such as elections. This can lead to the creation of regulations and standards requiring platforms and media to use verification tools, promoting a more transparent and reliable information environment.

**Education and Media Literacy:**
Finally, the dissemination and application of these technologies can drive educational and media literacy programs. Integrating these tools into the educational curriculum can teach students how fake news detection works and the importance of verifying information. This will prepare future generations to navigate the digital world more critically and consciously.
