## Analysis of initial impacts

The impacts that a solution that allows determining the veracity of a news item from its content and the most basic information (such as the title and date of publication) may have are as follows:

### Ethical aspect

Training can introduce biases, this is an inherent effect of training data, which after all is of human origin. It is critical to ensure that training data are diverse, representative, and from reliable sources. For example, manipulating the labels could lead the model to label as false relevant information that is intended to be censored or downplayed.

### Social impact

### If our solution is used correctly, it can increase public trust in the news by verifying authenticity. That is, reducing misinformation and several of its effects such as polarization.

### Legal aspects:

As part of the deployment we must ensure that we expose important information. For example, how decisions are made and what are the limitations of the system, so that it is understood that it is not an infallible mechanism and that possible mistakes do not correspond to bad intentions in the training of the model but to the inherent error that all forms of artificial intelligence present and try to minimize. 

On the other hand, there may be an impact on the handling of personal or non-rights-free data. To this end, care must be taken to avoid unauthorized disclosure of information and to use free or properly licensed content. 

### Economic impact

A trusted solution can attract users and organizations seeking to verify the authenticity of news. Sustaining such solutions involves updating the model so that it remains competent in its classification task. So it is possible to generate a business model around it.

### Conclusion

The development of a web service to identify true or fake news has the potential to be a valuable tool in the fight against disinformation. However, it should be implemented with caution, considering the possible ethical, social and legal impacts, and ensuring the transparency and accuracy of the system. In addition, it is important to complement this service with media literacy programs to empower users to evaluate information for themselves.
