## Context of the Problem:

In today's digital era, the rise of fake news has become a significant problem. These deceptive stories can negatively impact society, influencing what people think, decide, and do. It's crucial to detect and halt the spread of these fake news stories to ensure that the information we receive is reliable and truthful, thereby promoting an environment of honesty and trustworthiness in information dissemination.

## Project description:

The project focuses on developing a fake news detection system using machine learning techniques, specifically in the realm of binary classification. The aim is to build a model capable of distinguishing between real and fake news using textual data as input. This involves identifying linguistic and content characteristics that can differentiate between genuine and falsified news articles.
